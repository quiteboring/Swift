    Fast Path Generation

## About The Project

Swift Pathfinder is a high-performance A* pathfinder designed specifically for Minecraft. Its goal is to generate paths that feel **natural and player-like**, while remaining fast enough for real-time use.

Unlike purely optimal pathfinders, Swift balances efficiency with realism — producing smoother turns, sensible jumps, and believable traversal.
